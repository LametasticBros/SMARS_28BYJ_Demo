# Custom PCB made in KiCad 9

there are a few errors i fixed with copper wire
 - USB P and N reversed
 - Motors at 5V -> moved to 9V Supply
 - moved IO´s to match usecase


Planned for revision 2:
 - other  motors? More Speed?
 - switch to ESP32-S3 to have Dualcore
 - Universial i2c connector (Multiple?)
 - some analog stuff to monitor battery voltage
 - charging IC to have a 2s LiPo direct attached to the PCB
